  <h2>About Yum</h2>
  <p>Yum is the ultimate project for lazy but ambitious coders. It combines elegance, speed, and anime-level epicness in one futuristic package.</p>
  <p>Our goal is simple: make coding feel like an anime adventure, and create something huge without killing your vibe.</p>

  <h2>How Yum Works</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Project Overview:</strong><br>
    Yum is a cross-language runtime and binding layer designed to bridge C++ (and C) code with higher-level languages such as C# and Lua. It provides a flexible system for exposing C++ functionality to scripting environments, enabling rapid prototyping, extension, and integration in applications like game engines or automation tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong><br>
    The core of Yum consists of C++ libraries and C interfaces that expose various utilities (such as variant types, vectors, and callback registration) to other languages. The Yum runtime acts as a glue layer, allowing seamless communication between native code and managed or scripting environments.
  </p>
  <ul style="max-width:800px;margin:0 auto 20px;text-align:left;color:#ccc;">
    <li>
      <span class="badge">Variant Type System</span>
      The <b>Variant</b> class provides a type-safe container for different data types (integers, floats, booleans, strings, etc.), making it easy to pass values between languages without manual type conversions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="badge">Vector Utilities</span>
      <b>YcxxYum_Vec</b> and related functions offer dynamic array support, enabling efficient data exchange and manipulation from both C++ and scripting languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="badge">Callback Registration</span>
      Register C# (or other language) functions as callbacks, which can then be invoked from C++ code. Useful for event handling, scripting, and extending native functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="badge">Lua &amp; C# Bindings</span>
      Includes C interfaces and dynamic libraries to facilitate integration with Lua and C# environments, such as Godot or custom engines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="badge">Godot Integration</span>
      Extend Godot with custom native modules, providing high-performance features while retaining the flexibility of scripting.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, Yum simplifies the process of exposing C++ code to other languages, making it easier to build modular, extensible, and high-performance applications.
